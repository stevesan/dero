    how to make a door?
    doom spec line 1078
    linedef function
    S1
    T trigger model
    rightside of line
    11 == level exit

GENERAL GEOMETRY GEN:

    ok, we have the high level gen algo, with a tree of generators...but what about the geo? 
    the two-heightmaps approach? but want smooth diagonal lines
    we can probably figure out a way to smooth out the diags, and just keep the grid pretty high res.

    the 2-heights abstraction is nice, as it makes space-creation algos pretty easy to think about
    ie. distance field type ideas.

----------------------------------------

a list of spaces. each space has:
    region of grid
    entrance doors
    exit doors
    each door:
        tag if locked

issues with needy squidi algo:
    can often see key before seeing door.
    ok, just gonna be OK with this for now.

----------------------------------------


ok handle multiple heights...?

wall could be:
    1) finite area, no sector. for border
    2) a single impassible linedef. good for gates
    3) finite area, has sector that is too tall/low to pass. for windows.

ok i guess we do need to support all 3 cases...

1 naturally works, with is_unreachable
2 is default, 3 doesn't work yet.

seems like #2 should be the more rare case. like, explicity specify when you want these kind of walls. or jsut do it after the fact.
