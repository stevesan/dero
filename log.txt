NEXT: write doom wad!! with simple "idea" module

current algo:

    DONE seed spread
    DONE get conn graph
    DONE: compute MST
    do goal placement (squidi's idea)
    add allowed cycle (split tree into regions, etc.)

TODO: find better 2d math lib? euclid is alright. just need line intersection
