    find good python graph lib (find connected components, etc.)

General algo:

    GRAPH PHASE:

    scatter vertices
    given starting vert u and group p
    pick start vertex u
        spread to b nearest, unassigned vertices, assign as group p
            must be planar-accessible
        create random, planar edges to ensure all phase1 verts are connected
        choose one vertex from group p (or any previous phases, bias towards last group) as the "gate"
        recurse with gate as u

key vars:
    b is how large each group is. could be a function of group #

FILL PHASE:

    rasterize to image, create distance field, with nearest-group # (voronoi diagram)
    for each group, choose a fill algo.
        the "cave" algo:
            walk along borders of a group, randomly jitter in and out of distance field
        the "base" algo:
            try to fill with rectangles

        each group, choose a color scheme (using gamut method)
