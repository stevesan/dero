NEXT: construct more balanced spanning tree
NEXT: write doom wad!! with simple "idea" module
NEXT: need to bias key placement toward small subtrees

current algo:

    DONE seed spread
    DONE get conn graph
    DONE compute MST
    DONE do goal placement (squidi's idea)

        given exit pos, nodes per zone, key
        if key
            place key in any node, possibly far from exit

        up from exit, find biggest subtree <= nodes per zone
        make subtree myExit, make it locked.
        recurse( myExit, maxNodesPerZone, key=key(myExit) )

    add allowed cycles (split tree into regions, etc.)

TODO: find better 2d math lib? euclid is alright. just need line intersection

LATER: pre-fill smaller components before initial seedings
