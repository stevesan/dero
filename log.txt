    how to make a door?
    doom spec line 1078
    linedef function
    S1
    T trigger model
    rightside of line
    11 == level exit

GENERAL GEOMETRY GEN:

    ok, we have the high level gen algo, with a tree of generators...but what about the geo? 
    the two-heightmaps approach? but want smooth diagonal lines
    we can probably figure out a way to smooth out the diags, and just keep the grid pretty high res.

    the 2-heights abstraction is nice, as it makes space-creation algos pretty easy to think about
    ie. distance field type ideas.

a list of spaces. each space has:
    region of grid
    entrance doors
    exit doors
    each door:
        tag if locked

issues with needy squidi algo:
    can often see key before seeing door.
    ok, just gonna be OK with this for now.
