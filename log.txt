GENERAL GEOMETRY GEN:

    ok, we have the high level gen algo, with a tree of generators...but what about the geo? 
    the two-heightmaps approach? but want smooth diagonal lines
    we can probably figure out a way to smooth out the diags, and just keep the grid pretty high res.

    the 2-heights abstraction is nice, as it makes space-creation algos pretty easy to think about
    ie. distance field type ideas.

----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------

a list of spaces. each space has:
    region of grid
    entrance doors
    exit doors
    each door:
        tag if locked

issues with needy squidi algo:
    can often see key before seeing door.
    ok, just gonna be OK with this for now.



ok handle multiple heights...?

wall could be:
    1) finite area, no sector. for border
    2) a single impassible linedef. good for gates
    3) finite area, has sector that is too tall/low to pass. for windows.

ok i guess we do need to support all 3 cases...

1 naturally works, with is_unreachable
2 is default, 3 doesn't work yet.

seems like #2 should be the more rare case. like, explicity specify when you want these kind of walls. or jsut do it after the fact.
should make the grid part have walls with area. ie two zones should not actually touch on the grid
the super sampling is ok..but in general, i don't think we necessarily need to take that approach.
i think the coarse-grid should serve as a logical grid, and should perhaps impose some critical path logic to guide the generators.

critical path inside each zone. pick a "hub" spot, compute shortest path from each door to it, ensure that path is never blocked by per-zone algo
    we can use PoE's perlin noise weighting to make crit paths more wiggly.

addressing blockiness: we don't need to always use the zone grid to generate geometry. we only need to respect the boundaries it imposes. for example, we can do simplification, but still respect the boundaries and the critical paths.

zone grid: stores info about zone boundaries and critical paths. general rule: you are not allowed to go outside your zone cells, and you're not allowed to go into the crit path by more than 1 cell.

zone grid is the coarse grid, before the super-sampling/separation we do now. separation is a valid op.

now we need to think about...how would we actually generate stuff in a free form manner? randomly placing items, decorations, etc.

OBSERVATION: lower res initial grid results in more snaking zones. i guess finer blob spreading just results in pretty circular blobs..
    ok this isn't necessarily something to worry about. the snaking-feeling should come from the zone-gen themselves.

i tried the separation algorithm running on the non-zone-collated space tree. much more complex looking results
get door side textures to stop scrolling?
    done with Lower Unpegged on adjacent linedefs
sometimes doors don't open from a side. make sure all two-sided LDs are set to function 31
    must be right side!
door sectors next to another is not good. need to do the 3x1 separation
doors only rise up to neighboring heights or something. definitely need to isolate areas around them.
get Box2D for python!
    meh fuck it for now
actually, using box2D may be overkill for the 'manmade' style. something much more procedural may be preferable. ie. generate a sequence of symmetric pieces in a tree order.
    the shape-gen could be tunnel-like, symmetric piece, non-symmetric, etc.

critical path
finer voxel grid for geometric detailing
geo simplification

we can have various algorithms for filling space:
- seed spread - 'shape grow' method
    currently implemented as method2.
- 'pile of pieces' shape-then-fit method.
    ues box2D

how can we get the tree for the shape-then-fit method?

ACCESS GRID
    1 cell == player fits.
    2 nboring free cells == player can move freely between both
SPACE GRAPH
    lock-key puzzles
VOXEL-GRID
    much finer grained grid for actually synthesizing the map
MAP
    the final DOOM geometry. linedefs, etc.
seeing key before door happens A LOT
    mine minimaps to show keys and doors!

color doors in wad dumps

the fill-path paradigm:
    shape algos can do whatever they want, but later on, the "tunneling algo" will use weighted-A-star to ensure paths.
    AND, shape algos can define weights! ex. if you build a room with four walls and four POSSIBLE entrances, you should make the entrance voxels (1 per wall) have small weight compared to the rest of the wall voxels, so the pathing algo will be very likely to break one of those voxels.
create some interesting fill algos!
    symmetic spread
should make everything soft except the walls aroudn the area, and then in those walls, poke soft holes
connecting zones: do not be bound to the pre-defined doors!
in the zone-step, it should just define which zones are adjacent, not how to get to them.
clear_paths should be responsible for the exact paths.
tunnels too long
    need to fit shapes together, rather than innital region-spread method
area shapes too concave
----------------------------------------

SHAPE GEN: need shape generator with continuous parameters:
    convexity
    symmetry
        how many folds?
        continuous value.. if 0 to 1, copy along one axis, with some probability of actually respecting the copy.

ALWAYS REMEMBER: it's not just about what's "possible" it's about controlling the *distribution*
    random blobs make anything like this possible, but not necessarily likely.


regular n-gons have n axis of symmetry

partial symmetry:
    
symmetry def:
N = number of fills
count how many fills do not have reflected pairs
